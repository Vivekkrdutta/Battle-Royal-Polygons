# 🤖 Battle Royal : Polygon Edition
Welcome to the battle ground 🔫! This repository contains brienf information on how to *downlaod / Play / Use this Game as your own project* and extend its scope to further heights. It was built with Unity Engine ⚙, using Assets packs from Completely Free 🌟 sources , and Multiplayer facilities taken from Unity's Multiplayer Services + Netcode for GameObjects 🧩.

The Game features an astonishing combination of Battle Royal Games 🪖 like Pubg, Free Fire, Valorant etc with the twist of Polygon styled characters 👮‍♂ and environments 🌄. It contains the [Polygon Battle Royal Pack](https://devfreedom.club/polygon-battle-royale-pack/) , [Unity's Particles Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/particle-pack-127325?srsltid=AfmBOorwuzsS4aaHw6vj6ApQPMHCXG8L2Ly2r3L5iApOgSf--9Soao1C), and many other ones prescribed under the *Package* Folder. ( Import the Project for more details ).

*The Animations* used in the project are from Unity's [Starter Assets Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/starter-assets-thirdperson-updates-in-new-charactercontroller-pa-196526?srsltid=AfmBOopP0umqfeeYYGcvtkrS9E6oFYm6q8zePUEhSDH5oabfpJurVwJq) and from [Mixamo.com](https://www.mixamo.com/).

*For NPCs ( Non Playing Characters, referred to as "Bots")* , Navmesh from Unity's AI features have been used.

It relies on the Client-server architecture with one client (player ) having to host a game ( act as the server ) and other clients ( players) having to join the game . The game can be of two types -
- 🎪*Public* : A public room is visible and accessible to all the clients searching for a game. This is preferred type of hosting.
- 🧱*private* : Any client need to have the joining code to join a private room.<br><br>
